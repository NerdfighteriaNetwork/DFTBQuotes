[2025.59] <~root> I'm glad I did that and if they have another show someday I will do it again
[2026.15] <~root> also I registered the blogtv account 'Nerdfighteria_IRC' because guest chattign was disabled
[2026.42] root doesn't remember if he already had a blogtv account
[2027.04] <Xai> BItching. :D
[2028.49] <%Tyrope> I have a request, can people copy-paste the last like, 5 lines (say, from root's line saying he's glad) to fpaste.org? It's for the DFTBQuotes project

20:41:22	<Sacha>: Hey :)
20:41:27	<Tyrope>: oh, mibbit and qwebirc...
20:41:35	Tyrope needs samples of those.
20:41:37	<elad>: As for dmesg, it just shows messages from the "kernel ring buffer". Usually device event and debug data

20:42:25	<Tyrope>: Sacha: could you copy-paste the lines from your 'hey' to this one, and put it on fpaste.org or pastebin.com? It's for the quote database we're making.  :)
